- 👋 Hi, I’m @tnaccarato
- 🌱 I am a MSc Advanced Computer Science student, already holding a MSci in Biomedical Science (2:1) and am looking for my first position as a Software Engineer. After discovering a love of coding whilst working on my final thesis, I enrolled on HyperionDev’s (in partnership with the University of Edinburgh) software engineering bootcamp. I have a particular interest in Python and Java but am very flexible and would consider any Software Engineering roles. 
 
At HyperionDev, I:
  - Graduated top of class and achieved an average grade of 100%.
  - Designed and generated a custom database using SQL for a small architectural firm which was implemented for use in a Java-based project management system.
  - Developed and trained a polynomial regression model in Python using sklearn to plot the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and deaths in the United Kingdom.
  - Created and executed custom JUnit and pytest unit tests.
  - Generated detailed Javadoc and docstring documentation for applications.

My master’s dissertation (grade awarded: 1st) was entitled “A Multiplatform Genome Analysis of Astrocytoma Tumour Data for the Purpose of Identifying Repositionable Clinical Drug Targets for Use in Personalised Cancer Therapy”. For this project I was required to teach myself the coding language R in a matter of months using online courses available on edX from Harvard and the University System of Maryland (USMx). This enabled me to carry out a complex statistical analysis using large datasets from a variety of sources including the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), DrugBank and the Open Target Platform in combination with a wide range of literature.
